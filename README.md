# Test Buurtvitaal JS App

App use [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/). 

## Prerequisites
* Node.js - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/). You can also follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) for a quick and easy way to install Node.js and npm
* MongoDB - Download and Install [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) - Make sure `mongod` is running on the default port (27017).

### Tools Prerequisites
* NPM - Node.js package manage; should be installed when you install node.js.
* Bower - Web package manager. Installing [Bower](http://bower.io/) is simple when you have `npm`:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

### Optional
* Grunt - Download and Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).

```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Additional Packages
* Express - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* Mongoose - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* Passport - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* AngularJS - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.
* Twitter Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.
* UI Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.

## Quick Install
  
  Install:
  
    $ npm install
     
    if error: Failed to execute "git ls-remote --tags --heads git://github.com/angular/bower-angular.git", exit code of #128
    $ git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
    
    
    


  To start the server:

    $ grunt

  If grunt aborts because of JSHINT errors, these can be overridden with the `force` flag:

    $ grunt -f

  Alternatively, when not using `grunt` you can run:

    $ node server

  Then, open a browser and go to:

    http://localhost:3000


## Troubleshooting
During install some of you may encounter some issues.

Most issues can be solved by one of the following tips, but if are unable to find a solution feel free to contact us via the repository issue tracker or the links provided below.

#### Update NPM, Bower or Grunt
Sometimes you may find there is a weird error during install like npm's *Error: ENOENT*. Usually updating those tools to the latest version solves the issue.

* Updating NPM:
```
$ npm update -g npm
```

* Updating Grunt:
```
$ npm update -g grunt-cli
```

* Updating Bower:
```
$ npm update -g bower
```

#### Cleaning NPM and Bower cache
NPM and Bower has a caching system for holding packages that you already installed.
We found that often cleaning the cache solves some troubles this system creates.

* NPM Clean Cache:
```
$ npm cache clean
```

* Bower Clean Cache:
```
$ bower cache clean
```

### Environmental Settings

There are three environments provided by default: __development__, __test__, and __production__.

Each of these environments has the following configuration options:

 * __db__ - This is the name of the MongoDB database to use, and is set by default to __mean-dev__ for the development environment.
* __app.name__ - This is the name of your app or website, and can be different for each environment. You can tell which environment you are running by looking at the TITLE attribute that your app generates.
* __Social OAuth Keys__ - Facebook, GitHub, Google, Twitter. You can specify your own social application keys here for each platform:
  * __clientID__
  * __clientSecret__
  * __callbackURL__
* __mailer__ - This is where you enter your email service provider, username and password

To run with a different environment, just specify NODE_ENV as you call grunt:

    $ NODE_ENV=test grunt

If you are using node instead of grunt, it is very similar:

    $ NODE_ENV=test node server

To simply run tests

    $ npm test
